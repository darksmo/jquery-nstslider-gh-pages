  "readme": "mimosa-less\n===========\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is a Less compiler for the Mimosa build tool. This module is for use with Mimosa `2.0+`.  This replicates the functionality of the Less compiler that was built into Mimosa before `2.0`.\n\nFor more information regarding Mimosa, see http://mimosa.io\n\nNote: Version `1.1.0` works with Mimosa `2.0.8` and above.\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd `'less'` to your list of modules.  That's all!  Mimosa will install the module for you when you start `mimosa watch` or `mimosa build`.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThis module will compile Less files during `mimosa watch` and `mimosa build`.  It includes source maps by default.\n\n## Default Config\n\n```coffeescript\nless:\n  lib: undefined\n  sourceMap: true\n  extensions: [\"less\"]\n```\n\n* `lib`: You may want to use this module but may not be ready to use the latest version of Less. Using the `lib` property you can provide a specific version of Less if the one being used by this module isn't to your liking. To provide a specific version, you must have it `npm install`ed into your project and then provide it to `lib`. For instance: `lib: require('less')`.\n* `sourceMap`: a less compiler option to turn on/off source maps. They are [Dynamic source maps](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/46/) which require no extra network hops to retrieve the original source or the map files. `sourceMap` is automatically set to `false` during `mimosa build`.\n* `extensions`: an array of strings, the extensions of your Less files.\n",
